# OS AI Assistant Docs

This repository includes planning notes, tuning steps, and automation reports. The indexer should chunk this document to exercise the pipeline.

The assistant reads markdown, text, JSON, and PDF files. Each chunk uses deterministic identifiers and metadata with byte offsets. Embeddings are produced through a stub to keep local runs reproducible.
